## AI
Integrate AI into your editor
  Available in Start plan
  Integrate the AI Generation extension into your Tiptap Editor with 
  just a couple of lines of code. This extension equips you with a set
  of AI-enhanced features including pre-built commands, prompt
  customization, image generation, and smart autocompletion.

  Add your own custom commands on top and even integrate your own 
  proprietary LLM to create a unique user experience.\
  \
  AI Generation features
  Pre-configured default commands
  Autocompletion for efficient editing
  Real-time streaming for commands
  Compatibility with various OpenAI models (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, 
  gpt-5, dall-e-3)
  Create your own prompts and commands
  Custom LLM integration
  How it works
  Integrate OpenAI or your own Custom LLM with your Tiptap Editor. The 
  extension covers both, the client and server-side implementations.
  Here’s the user experience:

  Highlight text in the editor and apply an AI command.
  Your selection, the chosen action, and any options are sent to our 
  cloud service.
  We generate a prompt and engage OpenAI on your behalf.
  The AI's response is then directly inserted or streamed into your 
  editor.
  By default, this utilizes our backend service, but there are options 
  for advanced scenarios including custom backends and LLMs.\
  \
  \
  Show AI Suggestions in your editor
  Available in Team plan
  Beta
  The AI Suggestion extension analyzes the document and shows 
  suggestions that users can accept and reject. It works out-of-the-box
   with Content AI Cloud, and can be easily extended to work with your
  own backend and LLMs.\
  \
  Features
  Define your own rules to enforce your style guide, improve 
  readability, and ensure that your users' content follows best
  practices.
  Apply suggestions: Replace words, phrases, or sentences with 
  suggestions generated by the AI Suggestion extension.
  Rich text support in suggestions, so you can enforce style rules like
   formatting keywords in bold or italic.
  Integrate your own backend and LLMs
  Customize the user interface: Full control over how suggestions are 
  displayed on the editor.
  How It Works
  The AI Suggestion extension uses Tiptap Cloud's OpenAI models (or 
  your custom backend) to generate proofreading suggestions from your
  rules and the editor's content. The extension covers both the client
  and server-side implementations. Here is the user experience:

  When the editor loads, the AI Suggestion extension generates 
  suggestions based on its initial content and rules.
  If the user edits the rules or content, the extension's suggestions 
  are updated in real-time.
  The user can review and accept suggestions, or reject them.
  When a suggestion is accepted, the editor's content is updated with 
  the new text.\
  \
  Track and review AI-generated changes
  Available in Team plan
  Beta
  The AI Changes extension enables you to track, review, and manage 
  content modifications made by AI in your editor. It clearly
  highlights changes, making it easy to see what has been added or
  removed.

  Combine it with the AI Generation extension to create content and 
  provide your users with a seamless review workflow.\
  AI Changes features
  Integrates seamlessly with our AI Generation extension and AI Agent 
  extension
  Supports rich text formatting, including images, links, and mentions
  Enables users to accept and reject individual changes or make 
  adjustments to generated content
  Provides a fully customizable UI for displaying changes
  When to use AI Changes?
  The AI Changes extension displays changes after they are applied to 
  the document. To preview changes before they are applied, use the AI
  Suggestion extension. Follow the diff view guide.

  How it works
  The AI Changes extension adapts to your specific text editing 
  workflow. Integrate it in four simple steps:

  Install and configure the extension
  Edit the editor's content (for example, by inserting AI-generated 
  text)
  Display changes in the editor
  Review changes made by AI\
  AI Agent extension for Tiptap
  Available in Team plan
  Beta
  Integrate the AI Agent extension and build agents that edit rich‑text
   documents. Integrate a ready‑made assistant or add editing tools to
  your own agent.\
  The AI Agent extension lets you build an AI Assistant that can read, 
  answer questions, and edit your document based on a user-defined
  task.

  Already have an AI agent?
  Give it text-editing superpowers with Tiptap's AI Agent extension. It
   provides it the tools to read and edit rich text documents fast and
  efficiently.

  Key features
  Edits large documents fast and efficiently.
  Understands your document's structure, including custom elements.
  Integrates with external data sources and RAG pipelines.
  Is aware of the editor's selected content.
  Let your users review and accept/reject AI-generated changes.
  Use Tiptap's AI agent — or build your own
  There are two ways to use the AI Agent extension:

  Use it with Tiptap Cloud, which provides a managed, ready-to-use AI 
  agent.
  Add it to your existing AI agent, that's hosted in your backend.
  The AI Agent extension provides tool definitions for popular AI 
  provider libraries:

  AI SDK by Vercel
  LangChain.js
  OpenAI
  What are AI Agents?
  AI Agents are systems that can accomplish a complex task by making 
  independent decisions. Unlike simple chatbot assistants, AI Agents
  can not only respond with text, but also call "tools" that let them
  interact with the environment.

  The Tiptap AI Agent extension provides AI Agents the tools to perform
   these actions:

  Read the document
  Re-write the document's contents
  Make a plan, interact with the user, and create a summary of the 
  changes it made.
  These built-in tools are optimized for rich text editing and follow 
  LLM best practices, allowing you to focus on your application's core
  logic. You can combine them with custom tools for data retrieval.

  When an LLM is called with these tools, it selects one to execute. 
  Then, the Tiptap AI Agent extension applies it to the editor,
  modifying the document or reading its content in an efficient way. In
   a typical implementation, the LLM is called on the server, while the
   document editing happens in the browser.

  Think of the LLM as the "brain" of the AI agent, making decisions 
  about which tools to call. The Tiptap AI Agent extension acts as the
  "hands" and "eyes," enabling the agent to read and interact with the
  document.

  By using the AI Agent extension with Tiptap Cloud, you don't need to 
  worry about the server — we have it built for you. However, if you
  want to customize the LLM and the tools that the AI agent has
  available (so that it can perform other actions, like searching an
  external data source), you can integrate the AI Agent extension with
  your own backend.
